When Cal Newport wrote Deep Work in 2016, he warned that Wikipedia
and emails were killing our attention. Nine years later, in 2025,
it's worse—social media, AI, and notifications make it hard to think continuously.
We scroll X or tweak AI prompts and claim we're productive, but often it's just noise.

This struck close to home: What do you create when you are unable to focus?

In an age starved for real innovation, shallow work will simply not cut it.
Those who protect themselves from distractions and dive deeply into their
craft—whether coding, creating, or problem-solving—will rise above.
In order to succeed, we have to protect our attention as gold.
Turn off the pings, silence the focus time, and dig in to work that matters.

Without the ability to focus, our engagement with complex issues like the Palestinian
cause risks being limited to surface-level actions like posting or tweeting.
While these efforts can raise awareness, they often lack the depth needed for meaningful impact.

For example, [Tech for Palestine](https://techforpalestine.org/), a coalition of over 8,000 tech professionals,
channels focused effort into impactful projects like open-source datasets
documenting human tolls, boycott tools like [Boycat](https://www.boycat.io/),
and advocacy incubators to support Palestinian liberation. These initiatives,
driven by sustained, distraction-free work, provide tangible value—far beyond
fleeting social media posts—by empowering communities and shifting narratives toward justice.
True impact requires such deep, deliberate work to create lasting change.

**Focus, or get left behind in the noise!**
