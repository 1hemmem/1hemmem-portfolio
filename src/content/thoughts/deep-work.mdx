> The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

When Cal Newport wrote Deep Work in 2016, he warned that Wikipedia and emails were killing our attention. Nine years later, in 2025, it's worse—social media, AI, and notifications make it hard to think continuously. We scroll X or tweak AI prompts and claim we're productive, but often it's just noise.

This struck close to home: What do you create when you are unable to focus?

In an age starved for real innovation, shallow work will simply not cut it. Those who protect themselves from distractions and dive deeply into their craft—whether coding, creating, or problem-solving—will rise above. In order to succeed, we have to protect our attention as gold. Turn off the pings, silence the focus time, and dig in to work that matters.

**Focus, or get left behind in the noise!**
